# Analyzing Factors Influencing NBA Players' Performance: A Multiple Linear Regression Approach 

This is a repo of a project related to multiple linear regression from my statistics undergraduate course, STA302: Methods of Data Analysis I, at the University of Toronto. 

## Project Description

This study employs multiple linear regression analysis to identify factors impacting NBA players' performance, focusing on net rating as a key performance indicator. The research analyzes a comprehensive dataset of player demographics and performance metrics spanning from 1996 to 2021. Through exploratory data analysis, model formulation, and validation, the study investigates the relationships between various player attributes and their on-court effectiveness. The findings provide valuable insights for NBA teams to optimize player selection and strategies, highlighting the significance of specific performance-related variables in predicting player impact.
